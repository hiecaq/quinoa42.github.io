      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I come into the situation where I am forced to use Eclipse, one of those huge IDEs that isolate me from the warm terminal world. However, as a user of (neo)vim, nothing can stop me from doing things in a, at least, vim-like environment. At this moment, one tool comes into my mind: &lt;a href=&#34;http://eclim.org/index.html&#34;&gt;Eclim&lt;/a&gt;, which I have been wondering about since the time when I was still using Windows XP back in my high school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
