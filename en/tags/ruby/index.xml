      <description>It happens to be the case where I run into the need of using ruby and tk.Anyway, it tooks me a while to figure out how to compile a ruby by using rbenv and ruby-build with a brew-installed tcl-tk library.
install tcl-tk $ brew install tcl-tk Then add /usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/bin to your path.

if you install rbenv with HomeBrew, it should be already installed, but if not,</description>
