      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the so-called next generation of Firefox, 57, has become available as the nightly version, the death of XUL is no longer far away. As the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar&#34;&gt;Calendar&lt;/a&gt; suggests, as soon as 2017-11-14 Firefox 57 will become the stable released version, and ESR will become the only version that supports the dying XUL addons. While &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser&#34;&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt; could be a solution to save my way of exploring, it is still in alpha development and lacks some of my must-have features. So the problem is clear: whether to embrace the brand new Firefox 57 or stay back with Firefox ESR (52).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
