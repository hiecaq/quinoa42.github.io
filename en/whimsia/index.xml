      <description>As the so-called next generation of Firefox, 57, has become available as the nightly version, the death of XUL is no longer far away. As the Calendar suggests, as soon as 2017-11-14 Firefox 57 will become the stable released version, and ESR will become the only version that supports the dying XUL addons. While qutebrowser could be a solution to save my way of exploring, it is still in alpha development and lacks some of my must-have features.</description>
