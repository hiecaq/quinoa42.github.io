<p>As the so-called next generation of Firefox, 57, has become available as the nightly version, the death of XUL is no longer far away. As the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Calendar</a> suggests, as soon as 2017-11-14 Firefox 57 will become the stable released version, and ESR will become the only version that supports the dying XUL addons. While <a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser">qutebrowser</a> could be a solution to save my way of exploring, it is still in alpha development and lacks some of my must-have features. So the problem is clear: whether to embrace the brand new Firefox 57 or stay back with Firefox ESR (52).</p>

<h2 id="add-ons-immigration">Add-ons Immigration</h2>

<p>The biggest reason stops me from happily switch to Firefox 57 of course is the dying XUL add-ons. As a matter of fact, the new WebExtensions API lacks some crucial features, which as a result makes the port of some great add-ons of all time, among which we have Vimperator and Pentadactyl, totally impossible. However, there is also new hope: people are spontaneously doing work to extend WebExtensions API to make everything <a href="https://bugzil.la/1215061">possible</a>.</p>

<p>But, before that, life has to go on. I just tested some of the new add-ons recommended on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TFcEXMcKrwoIAECIVyBU0GPoSmRqZ7A0VBvqeKYVSww/htmlview">firefox-webext-list</a>,
and here are my result:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/5digits/dactyl">Pentadactyl</a> -&gt; <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saka-key/">Saka Key</a></dt>
<dd>I have to say this is not the perfect solution but it is almost the only way works in the current Firefox. While it supports browsing web with <code>hjkl</code> and <code>gg</code>, <code>G</code>, etc, and supports hint mode and set hotkeys for switching tabs, it stops working on any &ldquo;special pages&rdquo;, for example <code>about:blank</code> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Add-ons Marketplace</a>, which is not very nice (actually, bad) when you type several <code>gt</code> or your favorite keybinding but to find youself is trapped in such a special page and have to use mouse to move on. Also, there is no command bar so you cannot type <code>o</code> or <code>t</code> to open a url, not to mention the highly embeded ways of interactions between the commands you typed and Firefox. Anyway, I hope in the future we could have real vim-like add-ons in this fast new Firefox.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a></dt>
<dd>The port has been completed. It just works as it always be.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">NoScript</a></dt>
<dd>It is said that the port is on the way. There is one workaround called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/">uMatrix</a> but I haven&rsquo;t try it out.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> -&gt; <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/">Violentmonkey</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/">Tempermonkey</a></dt>
<dd>It is said that the port is on the way, but there are two peer add-ons developed in WebExtensions already. Neither of them is totally compatible with Greasemonkey, but I&rsquo;d choose Violentmonkey for now since it&rsquo;s new and open source.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish/">Stylish</a> -&gt; <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/xStyle/">xStyle</a></dt>
<dd>Similar to Greasemonkey, Stylish also has two successors, both of which are actually Chrome&rsquo;s Stylish forks. It is possible that the real Chrome&rsquo;s Stylish will be ported to Firefox, since Firefox supports WebExtensions now.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug</a></dt>
<dd>Firebug will die with the old XULs, but most of its functions has already been ported into the native Firefox&rsquo;s Web Developer Tools.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a> -&gt; <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchyomega/">SwitchyOmega</a></dt>
<dd>The famous SwitchyOmega has already been ported into Firefox, however it is still in alpha development. Plenty of bugs exist.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>While Firefox 57 is newer and extremely faster, I would choose to stay with Firefox ESR just for now. A world without my favorite Pentadactyl or any similar tools is too hard to live in, IMHO.</p>
